abstract = {Abstract Freshwater ecosystems are vast areas that are constantly changing and evolving. To maintain the ecosystem as well as the structures located close to bodies of water, frequent monitoring is required. Although dangerous and time consuming, manual operations are the conventional way of monitoring such areas. Recently, Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) have been proposed to undertake the monitoring task. As any other platform, ASVs have limitations, such as a restricted point of view and access only where the water is sufficiently deep. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can fly over any terrain and provide a “bird's-eye-view” of the environment. However, UAVs have limited operational time due to power constraints. Heterogeneous marsupial robotic systems use different types of robots to augment their operation envelope, taking advantage of their individual strengths. A marsupial survey system comprised an ASV and a UAV for freshwater monitoring is developed and presented in this paper. This system is able to complete long missions and reach remote locations while also being able to generate detailed maps and inspections of points of interest. The system was thoroughly tested during a 6-month period in a number of field deployments in freshwater ecosystems at Lake Murray and at the Congaree River, SC, USA, to validate its capabilities.},

abstract={Abstract: We introduce machine learning (ML) to perform classification and quantitation of images of nuclei from human blood neutrophils. Here we assessed the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using free, open source software to accurately quantitate neutrophil NETosis, a recently discovered process involved in multiple human diseases. CNNs achieved >94\% in performance accuracy in differentiating NETotic from non-NETotic cells and vastly facilitated dose-response analysis and screening of the NETotic response in neutrophils from patients. Using only features learned from nuclear morphology, CNNs can distinguish between NETosis and necrosis and between distinct NETosis signaling pathways, making them a precise tool for NETosis detection. Furthermore, by using CNNs and tools to determine object dispersion, we uncovered differences in NETotic nuclei clustering between major NETosis pathways that is useful in understanding NETosis signaling events. Our study also shows that neutrophils from patients with sickle cell disease were unresponsive to one of two major NETosis pathways. Thus, we demonstrate the design, performance, and implementation of ML tools for rapid quantitative and qualitative cell analysis in basic science.},

A communication map encodes information on whether two robots can communicate when they are at two arbitrary locations and plays a fundamental role for a multi-robot system deployment to reliably and effectively achieve a variety of tasks, such as environmental monitoring and exploration. Previous work on communication map building typically considered only scenarios with a fixed base station and designed offline methods, which did not exploit data collected online by the robots. This paper proposes Gaussian Process-based online methods to efficiently build a communication map with multiple robots. Such robots form a mesh network, where there is no fixed base station. Specifically, we provide two leader-follower online sensing strategies to coordinate and guide the robots while collecting data. Furthermore, we improve the performance and computational efficiency by exploiting prior communication models that can be built from the physical map of the environment. Extensive experimental results in simulation and with a team of TurtleBot 2 platforms validate the approach.},

abstract = {Abstract: Due to the recent technological progress, Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) has become a major field of research in both engineering and artistic realms, particularly so in the last decade. The mainstream interests are, however, extremely diverse: challenges are continuously shifting, the evolution of robot' skills, as well as the advances in methods for understanding their environment radically impact the design and implementation of research prototypes. When directly deployed in a public installation or artistic performances, robots help foster the next level of understanding in HRI. To this effect, this paper presents a successful interdisciplinary art-science-technology project, the Aerostabiles, leading to a new way of conducting HRI research. The project consists of developing a mechatronic, intelligent platform embodied in multiple geometric blimps – cubes – that hover and move in the air. The artistic context of this project required a number of advances in engineering on the aspects of localization and control systems, flight dynamics, as well as interaction strategies, and their evolution through periods of collective activities called "research–creation residencies". These events involve artists, engineers, and performers working in close collaboration, sometimes, over several weeks at a time. They generate fruitful exchanges between all researchers, but most of all, they present a unique and creative way to direct and focus the robotics development. This paper represents an overview of the technical contributions from a range of expertise through the artistic drive of the Aerostabiles project.},

abstract = {Abstract: The problem of coverage of known space arises in a multitude of domains, including search and rescue, mapping, and surveillance. In many of these applications, it is desirable or even necessary for the solution to guarantee both the complete coverage of the free space, as well as the efficiency of the generated trajectory in terms of distance traveled. A novel algorithm is introduced, based on the boustrophedon cellular decomposition technique, for computing an efficient complete coverage path for a known environment populated with arbitrary obstacles. This hierarchical approach first partitions the space to be covered into non-overlapping cells, then solves the Chinese postman problem to compute an Eulerian circuit traversing through these cells, and finally concatenates per-cell seed spreader motion patterns into a complete coverage path. Practical considerations of the coverage system are also explored for operations with a non-holonomic aerial vehicle. The effects of various system parameters are evaluated in controlled environments using a high-fidelity flight simulator, in addition to over 200 km of in-field flight sessions with a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle.},

abstract = {Abstract:This paper presents algorithmic solutions for the complete coverage path planning problem using a team of mobile robots. Multiple robots decrease the time to complete the coverage, but maximal efficiency is only achieved if the number of regions covered multiple times is minimized. A set of multi-robot coverage algorithms is presented that minimize repeat coverage. The algorithms use the same planar cellbased decomposition as the Boustrophedon single robot coverage algorithm, but provide extensions to handle how robots cover a single cell, and how robots are allocated among cells. Specifically, for the coverage task our choice of multi-robot policy strongly depends on the type of communication that exists between the robots.  When the robots operate under the line-of-sight communication restriction, keeping them as a team helps to minimize repeat coverage. When communication between the robots is available without any restrictions, the robots are initially distributed through space, and each one is allocated a virtually-bounded area to cover. A greedy auction mechanism is used for task/cell allocation among the robots. Experimental results from different simulated and real environments that illustrate our approach for different communication conditions are presented.},

The objective of the Avatar experiments is to develop and test concepts in support of future space exploration missions. Although some of the concepts can be (and have been!) tested on Earth by simulating space-relevant communication links, the benefits of conducting them from the ISS are numerous. First, the usage of an intermittent amateur radio link has raised several issues regarding the robustness of the software: it is impossible to cheat when the communication link really goes down. It has also allowed the team to develop unique operational expertise. One final advantage not to be neglected is the fact that these experiments will have provided flight heritage to the command and control concepts described in this article and to the software that was used to implement them. Such heritage is precious in the traditionally conservative space community.},

To solve this hybrid localization problem, we subdivide it into a local problem of camera-parameter estimation combined with a global planning and navigation problem. We solve the local camera-calibration problem by using fiducial markers embedded in the robot and by selecting robot trajectories in front of each camera that provide good calibration and field-of-view accuracy.We propagate information among the cameras and the successive positions of the robot using an Extended Kalman filter. Finally, we move the robot between the camera positions to explore the network using heuristic exploration strategies.

abstract = {Abstract: This paper presents a new map specifically designed for robots operating in large environments and possibly in higher dimensions. We call this map the hierarchical atlas because it is a multilevel and multiresolution representation. For this paper, the hierarchical atlas has two levels: at the highest level there is a topological map that organizes the free space into submaps at the lower level. The lower-level submaps are simply a collection of features. The hierarchical atlas allows us to perform calculations and run estimation techniques, such as Kalman filtering, in local areas without having to correlate and associate data for the entire map. This provides a means to explore and map large environments in the presence of uncertainty with a process named hierarchical simultaneous localization and mapping. As well as organizing information of the free space, the map also induces well-defined sensor-based control laws and a provably complete policy to explore unknown regions. The resulting map is also useful for other tasks such as navigation, obstacle avoidance, and global localization. Experimental results are presented showing successful map building and subsequent use of the map in large-scale spaces. },

A team of autonomous robots localizing themselves, in a communicationconstrained underwater environment, is essential for many applications such as underwater exploration, mapping, multirobot convoying, and other multi-robot tasks. Due to the profound difficulty of collecting ground truth images with accurate 6D poses underwater, this work utilizes rendered images from the Unreal Game Engine simulation for training. An image translation network is employed to bridge the gap between the rendered and the real images producing synthetic images for training. The proposed method predicts the 6D pose of an AUV from a single image as 2D image keypoints representing 8 corners of the 3D model of the AUV, and then the 6D pose in the camera coordinates is determined using RANSACbased PnP. Experimental results in underwater environments (swimming pool and ocean) with different cameras demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique, where the trained system decreased translation error by 75.5\% and orientation error by 64.6\% over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Movement of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) through a cluttered space, such as a shipwreck or a decorated cave, is an extremely challenging problem that has not been addressed in the past. This paper proposes a novel navigation framework utilizing an enhanced version of Trajopt for fast 3D path-optimization planning for AUVs. A sampling-based correction procedure ensures that the planning is not constrained by local minima, enabling navigation through narrow spaces. Two different modalities are proposed: planning with a known map results in efficient trajectories through cluttered spaces; operating in an unknown environment utilizes the point cloud from the visual features detected to navigate efficiently while avoiding the detected obstacles. The proposed approach is rigorously tested, both on simulation and in-pool experiments, proven to be fast enough to enable safe real-time 3D autonomous navigation for an AUV.},

There are many cases when even the experts (marine biologists) fail to recognize corals, hence limiting ground truth annotation for training a robust detection system. Identifying coral species is fundamental for enabling the monitoring of coral reefs, a task currently performed by humans, which can be automated with the use of underwater robots. By employing temporal cues using a tracker on a high confidence prediction by a convolutional neural network-based object detector, we augment the collected dataset for the retraining of the object detector. However, using trackers to extract examples also introduces hard or mislabelled samples, which is counterproductive and will deteriorate the performance of the detector. In this work, we show that employing a simple deep neural network to filter out hard or mislabelled samples can help regulate sample extraction. We empirically evaluate our approach in a coral object dataset, collected via an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and human divers, that shows the benefit of incorporating extracted examples obtained from tracking. This work also demonstrates how controlling sample generation by tracking using a simple deep neural network can further improve an object detector.},

Human data collection and monitoring is overly taxing and inconsistent when faced with large coverage areas, disturbed environments, and potentially uninhabitable situations. In contrast, the same missions become achievable with autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) configured and capable of accurately maneuvering in such environments. The two dynamic factors that present formidable challenges to completing precise maneuvers in coastal and moving waters are currents and winds. In this work, we present novel and inexpensive methods for sensing these external forces, together with methods for accurately controlling an ASV in the presence of such external forces.

In addition to the coral classification, the 3D position of each coral is identified producing a semantic map of the observed reef. Each coral is identified once and tracked to prevent a recount. The number of different coral species encountered in two separate traversed areas is reported. Furthermore, the shape and size of a coral can be extracted from the 3D reconstruction enabling the extraction of volumetric data for subsequent studies.

Most surveys of rivers are performed manually using quite similar approaches. Using these practices to automate these processes improves the quality of survey operations. In addition to human expertise on the type of patterns, the coverage of a river can be optimized using the river meanders to determine the direction of coverage. In this work we use the implicit information on the speed of the water current, inferred from the curves of the river, to reduce the cost of coverage. We use autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) to deploy the proposed methods and demonstrate the efficiency of our method. In addition we compare the proposed method with previous coverage techniques developed in our lab. When taking into account meanders the coverage time has been decreased in average by more than $20\%$.

In most robotic operations where the robot is not firmly grounded, such as aerial, surface, and underwater, minimal external forces are assumed as the standard operating procedures. The first action for operating in the presence of non-trivial forces is modeling the forces and their effect on the robots motion. In this work an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), operating on lakes and rivers with varying winds and currents, collects wind and current measurements with an inexpensive custom-made sensor suite setup, and generates a model of the force field. The modeling process takes into account depth, wind, and current measurements along with the ASVs trajectory from GPS. In this work, we propose a method for an ASV to build an environmental force map by integrating in a Gaussian Process the wind, depth, and current measurements gathered at the surface. We run extensive experimental field trials for our approach on real Jetyak ASVs. Experimental results from different locations validate the proposed modeling approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Multirobot systems for exploring initially unknown environments are often subject to communication constraints, due to the limited range of their transmission devices and to mission requirements. In order to make decisions about where the robots should move, a communication map that encodes knowledge of the locations from which communication is possible is usually employed. Typically, simple line of sight or circle communication models (that are rather independent of the specific environment in which the exploration is carried out) are considered. In this paper, we make a step forward and present a multirobot system that learns and updates a communication map during the exploration mission. In particular, we propose methods to incrementally update vertices, corresponding to the locations visited by robots, and edges, corresponding to communication links, of a graph according to the measured power of radio-frequency signals and to the predictions made by a model based on Gaussian Processes. Experimental results obtained in simulation show that the proposed methods build and update rich communication maps specific for the environments being visited and that the availability of these maps can improve the exploration performance. },

Such techniques have been able to achieve human-level performance in many tasks and have produced results of unprecedented accuracy. As DNNs have intense computational requirements in the majority of applications, they utilize a cluster of computers or a cutting edge Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), often having excessive power consumption and generating a lot of heat. In many robotics applications the above requirements prove to be a challenge, as there is limited power on-board and heat dissipation is always a problem. In particular in underwater robotics with limited space, the above two requirements have been proven prohibitive. As first of this kind, this paper aims at analyzing and comparing the performance of several stateof-the-art DNNs on different platforms. With a focus on the underwater domain, the capabilities of the Jetson TX2 from NVIDIA and the Neural Compute Stick from Intel are of particular interest. Experiments on standard datasets show how different platforms are usable on an actual robotic system, providing insights on the current state-of-the-art embedded systems.

Specifically, the number of measurements used to update the communication map, and the number of possible candidate locations where robots should go are reduced, by exploiting communication models that can be built from the physical map of the environment. This allows robots to take fewer measurements, travel less distance, be more efficient in processing the data online, and get similar accuracy to methods that consider all the locations in the environment.

coverage is the problem of moving an end-effector over all

the area coverage in terms of minimizing the operational

attrition. Unfortunately, the problem of finding an optimal

two approximation heuristics for solving the multi-robot

extension of an efficient single robot area coverage
algorithm, based on an exact cellular decomposition. The
second algorithm is a greedy approach that divides the area
into equal regions and applies an efficient single-robot
coverage algorithm to each region. We present experimental

These provide estimates of the radio signal strength and can be used to predict the presence of communication links between different locations of the environment. In the problem we consider, a team of mobile robots has to build such maps autonomously in a robot-to-robot communication setting. The solution we propose models the signal’s distribution with a Gaussian Process and exploits different online sensing strategies to coordinate and guide the robots during their data acquisition. Our methods show interesting operative insights both in simulations and on real TurtleBot 2 platforms.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper presents a systematic approach for the 3-D mapping of underwater caves. Exploration of underwater caves is very important for furthering our understanding of hydrogeology, managing efficiently water resources, and advancing our knowledge in marine archaeology. Underwater cave exploration by human divers however, is a tedious, labor intensive, extremely dangerous operation, and requires highly skilled people. As such, it is an excellent fit for robotic technology, which has never before been addressed. In addition to the underwater vision constraints, cave mapping presents extra challenges in the form of lack of natural illumination and harsh contrasts, resulting in failure for most of the state-of- the-art visual based state estimation packages. A new approach employing a stereo camera and a video-light is presented. Our approach utilizes the intersection of the cone of the video-light with the cave boundaries: walls, floor, and ceiling, resulting in the construction of a wire frame outline of the cave. Successive frames are combined using a state of the art visual odometry algorithm while simultaneously inferring scale through the stereo reconstruction. Results from experiments at a cave, part of the Sistema Camilo, Quintana Roo, Mexico, validate our approach. The cave wall reconstruction presented provides an immersive experience in 3-D.},

Deploying a robot in crowded spaces such as museums, shopping malls, department stores, or university campuses is especially challenging because the moving people occlude the static parts of the environment, such as walls and doorways, making the robot essentially blind. A new weighting function is proposed for a particle filter state estimation algorithm that accounts for the presence of dynamic obstacles and avoids population depletion. An active localization strategy is employed which guides the robot to locations that resolve ambiguities and eliminate hypotheses in a systematic manner. Experimental results from multiple simulations and from real robot deployments validate the localization improvements achieved by the proposed method.},

Several open source packages have appeared addressing the problem, each supported by im- pressive demonstrations.

Suboptimal perfor- mance, loss of localization, and challenges in customization have not produced a clear winner. Several other research groups have presented superb performance without releasing the code, sometimes materializing as commercial products. In this paper, ten of the most promising open source packages are evaluated, by cross validating them on the datasets provided for each package and by testing them on eight different datasets collected over the years in our laboratory. Indoor and outdoor, terrestrial and flying vehicles, in addition to underwater robots, cameras, and buoys were used to collect data. An analysis on the motions required for the different approaches and an evaluation of their performance is presented.

The direct and inverse kinematics are solved for a generic three-dimensional articulated hyper- redundant arm, that can be used as a proof of concept for more specific structures.

A multi-method approach was utilized. First, a subject matter expert (SME) interview was used to analyze video data of operators interacting with sAUVs. The results suggest considerations for the capabilities and limitations of the human and robot, in relation to the dynamic demands of the task and environment. A preliminary human factors conceptual model to depict and categorize these components was proposed. Next, a questionnaire was administered to sAUV roboticists (N=15) that assessed their perceptions related to the level of challenge associated to each of the factors identified in the model. The data suggest that all of the factors identified in our conceptual model are, in fact, challenging. In particular, our data suggest that situation awareness, communication, task complexity, visibility, and the robot’s user interface were some of the most challenging variables in sUAV operation.},

While such approaches are well known for their theoretical elegance, computing such representations in practice is complicated when the data is sparse and noisy. In this paper we present the online construction of a topological map and the implementation of a control law for guiding the robot to the nearest unexplored area. The proposed method operates by allowing the robot to localize itself on a partially constructed map, calculate a path to unexplored parts of the environment (frontiers), compute a robust terminating condition when the robot has fully explored the environment, and achieve loop closure detection. The proposed algorithm results in smooth safe paths for the robot’s navigation needs. The presented approach is an any-time-algorithm which allows for the active creation of topological maps from laserscan data, as it is being acquired. The resulting map is stable under variations to noise and the initial conditions. The key idea is the use of a flux-based skeletonization algorithm on the latest occupancy grid map. We also propose a navigation strategy based on a heuristic where the robot is directed towards nodes in the topological map that open to empty space. The method is evaluated on both synthetic data and in the context of active exploration using a Turtlebot 2. Our results demonstrate complete mapping of different environments with smooth topological abstraction without spurious edges.},

They collect Lagrangian current observations as they move along the water surface. In addition to the current measurements, the drifters are also recording image data that provide insights about the health of the marine life below the surface.

The problem becomes harder if the localization system must be low-cost and lightweight enough that only consumer-grade cameras can be used. This paper presents an analytical solution to the six degrees of freedom cooperative localization problem using bearing only measurements. Given two mutually observing robots, each one equipped with a camera and two markers, and given that they each take a picture at the same moment, we can recover the coordinate transformation that expresses the pose of one robot in the frame of reference of the other. The novelty of our approach is the use of two pairs of bearing measurements for the pose estimation instead of using both bearing and range measurements. The accuracy of the results is verified in extensive simulations and in experiments with real hardware. At 6.5 m distance, position was estimated with a mean error between 0.021 m and 0.025 m and orientation was recovered with a mean error between 0.019 rad and 0.037 rad. This makes our solution particularly well suited for deployment on fleets of inexpensive robots moving in 6 DoF such as blimps.},

Each robot uses its own pose estimate to localize every camera it encounters. This is achieved by using the camera observation of the robot to extract a 6-DoF transformation between the camera and the robot. The inverted transformation places the camera in the robots global frame of reference, and map merging among the multiple robots places the cameras and the team of robots in a common frame of reference. At the core of the estimation, an extended Kalman filter algorithm is used to estimate the joint pose of robots and cameras.

  abstract = {Abstract: In this paper we present the computer vision component of a 6DOF pose estimation algorithm to be used by an underwater robot. Our goal is to evaluate which feature trackers enable us to accurately estimate the 3D positions of features, as quickly as possible. To this end, we perform an evaluation of available detectors, descriptors, and matching schemes, over different underwater datasets. We are interested in identifying combinations in this search space that are suitable for use in structure from motion algorithms, and more generally, vision-aided localization algorithms that use a monocular camera. Our evaluation includes frame-by-frame statistics of desired attributes, as well as measures of robustness expressed as the length of tracked features. We compare the fit of each combination based on the following attributes: number of extracted keypoints per frame, length of feature tracks, average tracking time per frame, number of false positive matches between frames. Several datasets were used, collected in different underwater locations and under different lighting and visibility conditions },

  abstract = {Abstract: We examine the problem of learning a visual map of the environment based on discrete landmarks. While making this map we seek to maintain an accurate pose estimate for the mapping robots. Our approach is based on using a team of at least two (heterogeneous) mobile robots in a simple collaborative scheme. In many mapping contexts, a robot moves about the environment collecting data (images, in particular) which are later used to assemble a map; we view the map construction as both a knowledge acquisition and a training process. Without reference to the environment, as a robot collects training images, its position estimate accumulates errors, thus corrupting its estimate of the positions from which observations are taken. We address this problem by deploying a second robot to observe the first one as it explores, thereby establishing a virtual tether, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robot’s position while it constructs the map. We refer to this process as cooperative localization. The images collected during this process are assembled into a representation that allows vision-based position estimation from a single image at a later time. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our approach experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method in over 90 trials.},

The optimal solution to the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) is used to calculate an Euler tour, which guarantees complete coverage of the available free space while minimizing the path of the robot. In addition, we extend the classical solution of the CPP to account for the entry point of the robot for cell coverage by changing the weights of the Reeb graph edges.

This paper presents an overview of the approaches used during underwater sea trials in the coral reefs of Barbados, for two amphibious mobile robots and a set of underwater sensor nodes. We present control mechanisms used for maintaining a preset trajectory during enhanced teleoperations and discuss their experimental results. This is followed by a discussion on amphibious data gathering experi- ments conducted on the beach. We then present a tetherless underwater communication approach based on pure vision for high-level control of an underwater vehicle.

The proposed approach does not require these parameters to be specified in advance. Spectral models are useful for underwater applications, where subtle differences in color need to be distinguished. Such models are also useful for fusing information from multiple images. We show that the proposed approach yields promising results.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In this paper, we consider a hybrid solution to the sensor net- work position inference problem, which combines a real-time filtering system with information from a more expensive, global inference procedure to improve accuracy and prevent divergence. Many online solutions for this problem make use of simplifying assumptions, such as Gaussian noise models and linear system behaviour and also adopt a filtering strategy which may not use available information optimally. These assumptions allow near real-time inference, while also limit- ing accuracy and introducing the potential for ill-conditioning and divergence. We consider augmenting a particular real- time estimation method, the extended Kalman filter (EKF), with a more complex, but more highly accurate, inference technique based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology. Conventional MCMC techniques applied to this problem can entail significant and time consuming com- putation to achieve convergence. To address this, we propose an intelligent bootstrapping process and the use of parallel, communicative chains of different temperatures, commonly referred to as parallel tempering. The combined approach is shown to provide substantial improvement in a realistic sim- ulated mapping environment and when applied to a complex physical system involving a robotic platform moving in an office environment instrumented with a camera sensor network.},

Our approach is based on using two robots in a simple collaborative scheme; in practice, one  of these robots can be much less capable than the other. In many mapping contexts, a robot moves about collecting data (images, in particular) which are later used to assemble a map; we can  think of map construction as a training process. Without outside information, as a robot collects training images, its position estimate accumulates errors, thus corrupting its knowledge of the positions from which observations are taken.  We address this problem by deploying a second robot to observe the first one as it explores, thereby establishing a \emph{virtual tether}, and enabling an accurate estimate of the robot's position while it constructs the map. We refer to this process as \emph{cooperative localization}.  The images collected during this process are assembled into a representation that allows vision-based position estimation from a single image at a later date. In addition to developing a formalism and concept, we validate our results experimentally and present quantitative results demonstrating the performance of the method in over 90 trials. },

The environment is modeled as an arbitrary undirected planar graph which is initially unknown to the robot.

The robot is assumed to be able to autonomously  traverse graph edges, recognize when it has reached a vertex, and enumerate edges incident upon the current vertex. The robot cannot measure distances nor does it have a compass, but it is equipped with a single marker that it can leave at a vertex and sense if the marker is present at a newly visited vertex. The total number of edges traversed while constructing a map of a graph is used as a measure of performance. We present an efficient algorithm for learning an unknown, undirected planar graph by a robot equipped with one marker. One of the main results of this paper is to show that our strategy leads to performance that is typical linear in the size of the graph.

In the past, many algorithms have been proposed for estimating the relative velocity from one or more images. The motion blur is generally considered an extra source of noise and is eliminated, or is assumed nonexistent.  Unlike most of these approaches, it is feasible to estimate the Optical Flow map using only the information encoded in the motion blur. An algorithm that estimates the velocity vector of an image patch using the motion blur only is presented; all the required information comes from the frequency domain. The first step consists of using the response of a family of steerable filters applied on the log of the Power Spectrum in order to calculate the orientation of the velocity vector. The second step uses a technique called Cepstral Analysis. More precisely, the log power spectrum is treated as another signal and we examine the Inverse Fourier Transform of it in order to estimate the magnitude of the velocity vector.

The first contribution is the use  of cooperative localization for  decoupling  the positional error of a moving robot from its environment.  The second contribution is the development of efficient multi-robot exploration strategies for an unknown environment.

The proposed method is designed to be robust in the face of arbitrarily large odometry errors or objects with poor reflectance characteristics. Central to  the exploration strategy is a  sensor (robot tracker) mounted on a robot that could track a second mobile robot and accurately report its relative position. Our exploration strategies use the robot tracker sensor to sweep areas of free space between stationary and moving robots and to generate a graph-based description of the environment. This graph is used to guide the exploration process. Depending on the size of the environment relative to the range of the robot tracker, different spatial decompositions are used: a triangulation or a trapezoidal decomposition of the free space. Complete exploration without any overlaps is guaranteed as a result of the guidance provided by the dual graph of the spatial decomposition of the environment.

The uncertainty in absolute robot positions and the resulting uncertainty in the map is reduced through the use of a probabilistic framework based on particle filtering (a Monte Carlo simulation technique). Particle filtering is a probabilistic sampling technique used to efficiently  model complex probability distributions that cannot be effectively described using classical methods (such as Kalman filters).

We present experimental results from two different implementations of the robot tracker sensor, in simulated and in real environments. The accuracy of the resulting map increases with the use of cooperative localization. Furthermore, the deterioration of the floor conditions did not affect the quality of the map verifying the decoupling of positioning error from the environment.},

abstract = {Abstract: When the relative velocity between the different objects in a scene and the camera is relative large -- compared with the camera's exposure time -- in the resulting image we have a distortion called motion blur. In the past, a lot of algorithms have been proposed for estimating the relative velocity from one or, most of the time, more images. The motion blur is generally considered an extra source of noise and is eliminated, or is assumed nonexistent. Unlike most of these approaches, it is feasible to estimate the Optical Flow map using only the information encoded in the motion blur. This thesis presents an algorithm that estimates the velocity vector of an image patch using the motion blur only, in two steps. The information used for the estimation of the velocity vectors is extracted from the frequency domain, and the most computationally expensive operation is the Fast Fourier Transform that transforms the image from the spatial to the frequency domain. Consequently, the complexity of the algorithm is bound by this operation into O(n log(n)). The first step consists of using the response of a family of steerable filters applied on the log of the Power Spectrum in order to calculate the orientation of the velocity vector. The second step uses a technique called Cepstral Analysis. More precisely, the log power spectrum is treated as another signal and we examine the Inverse Fourier Transform of it in order to estimate the magnitude of the velocity vector. Experiments have been conducted on artificially blurred images and with real world data, and an error analysis on these results is also presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Background/Question/Methods
One of the foremost challenges in science is successfully predicting whether something will happen at a new place or time. Until recently, ecologists have assumed that reliable predictions would be possible only after we attained complete understanding, and so we did not try to predict the phenomena of interest. However, inspired by the push for iterative near-term ecological forecasting led by the Ecological Forecasting Initiative, ecologists are beginning to make predictions even with incomplete understanding – spurred by the idea that we will learn more by forecasting and failing, than by sticking with business as usual.

Near-term, iterative forecasts are urgently needed in fields where the phenomena of interest impact human health and well-being. For example, nuisance cyanobacterial blooms, which threaten the irreplaceable ecosystem services provided by freshwater lakes, are growing in frequency, magnitude, and duration worldwide. While the ultimate causes of blooms are characterized, identifying the proximate triggers of these events and forecasting incipient blooms are still major challenges due, in part, to the limited spatial and temporal resolution of the available data and the lack of real-time or near-real-time data integration.

This poster will describe several ongoing interdisciplinary, interconnected projects to predict cyanobacterial blooms using new tools and technologies.

Results/Conclusions

Work to date suggests that our partnerships, tools, and technologies will lead to scalable models for predicting cyanobacterial blooms. For example, we have identified the dominant sources of uncertainty in near-term predictions for a focal cyanobacterial species using relatively simple Bayesian state-space models fit to an ongoing weekly time series from oligotrophic Lake Sunapee, NH. This work provides the first estimate of uncertainty contributions for cyanobacterial predictions in an oligotrophic lake and suggests that more complex models, or model ensembles, that incorporate both abiotic and biotic factors are needed. This finding informs a new project to generate bloom forecasts from ‘big data’ collected across space and through time using sensors on fixed buoys, autonomous surface vehicles (robots), and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). We will integrate these data streams in near real-time, then use machine learning and Bayesian modeling to improve bloom prediction capabilities, testing our models with data from traditional field sampling programs and state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing platforms. Our overarching goal is to generate bloom forecasts that will help lake managers preemptively manage water quality, provide advance warning of potential recreational water closures, and inform policy making.},

Particularly when an area of interest has unstructured boundaries, such as rivers, the state-of the art approaches of area coverage path planning are not directly applicable. In addition, during coverage operations, and path planning in general, in dynamic environments inaccurate navigation from waypoint to waypoint presents extra challenges. In this work we present an overview of different patterns that can be utilized for river coverage in surveying, water sampling, and bathymetric mapping operations. In addition we discuss how a reactive method can be used for more accurate navigation when the environmental forces affect the navigation of the surface vehicle. Described methods have been tested utilizing an autonomous surface vehicle on different segments of the Congaree River in South Carolina, USA. All experiments resulted in total of more than 55km of coverage trajectories in the field.},

We presents a complete framework for survey operations: waypoint generation, modelling of forces and tuning the control. In many applications of environmental monitoring, search and exploration, and bathymetric mapping, the vehicle has to traverse in straight lines parallel to each other, ensuring there are no gaps and no redundant coverage. During operations with an Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) however, the presence of wind and/or currents produces external forces acting on the vehicle which quite often divert it from its intended path. Similar issues have been encountered during aerial or underwater operations. By measuring these phenomena, wind and current, and modelling their impact on the vessel, actions can be taken to alleviate their effect and ensure the correct trajectory is followed.

In addition, point annotation, the labeling method used for coral reef images by marine biologists, is prone to mislabeling. Point annotation also makes existing datasets incompatible with state-of-the-art classification methods which use the bounding box annotation technique. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, Multi-Patch Dense Network (MDNet) that can learn to classify coral species from point annotated visual data. The proposed approach utilizes patches of different scale centered on point annotated objects. Furthermore, MDNet utilizes dense connectivity among layers to reduce over-fitting on imbalanced datasets. Experimental results on the Moorea Labeled Coral (MLC) benchmark dataset are presented. The proposed MDNet achieves higher accuracy and average class precision than the state-of-the-art approaches. },

Nowadays, demonstrations showed that those vehicles can fly, dive, surf, or drive while carrying out missions autonomously in some specific scenarios. Monitoring vehicles during missions is a crucial and challenging task to avoid the unnecessary cost of losing vehicles or potential accidents. In this paper, we present a cheap yet effective way for monitoring and communicating with autonomous vehicles over long distances by using off-the-shelf 900 MHz modems namely RFD 900+ and high gain antennas. Although the 900 MHz band has been around for over two decades, no complete analysis exists providing guidelines to use off the shelf modems for point-to-point and multi-point communications. Our main contribution is to provide experimental analysis of the communication capabilities in point-to-point and multi-point scenarios in both line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) using an affordable setup (\$70 per modem). Experiments were carried out using autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) as remote nodes and computers as Ground Control Stations (GCSs).},

In general, additively manufactured parts have reduced mechanical properties in the build direction of the print. Moreover, for shell-like structures, buckling is a dominant failure mode when loaded in compression, which introduces additional bending stresses in the interface between two subsequently printed layers. There is a need for reinforcement of both the material and the structures. A promising solution to the above mentioned problems is addition of local reinforcements constructed in the build direction of the base geometry. In this paper, a solution for these process defects and structural instabilities is proposed through modification of toolpathing and addition of both global and local features with multi-orientation slicing techniques. Designed for use with the broad range of capabilities of modern industrial robotics, a 6-axis directional reinforcement can be added to various types of base geometries. Through examples, two fundamental cases are elaborated: an example of the multi-axis deposition is discussed in this paper by adding a predefined feature to the side of existing geometry and in a second case, a set of global stiffeners is added to a base geometry. The methods discussed in this paper show great promise for additive manufacturing on 6 degree of freedom platforms.},

Current research on formation control often relies on the use of an external motion capture equipment to track the pose of each individual robot.

In this paper, we show a proof of concept of a bearing-only relative localization approach in the context of maintaining flying formations, by recovering the 6 Degree of Freedom (DoF) relative pose between a pair of flying vehicles. This relative pose, estimated from a pair of images from mutually observing robots, is directly used to guide a follower quadrotor to keep a fixed position with respect to a leader.

abstract = {Abstract:  Initiated as a research-creation project by professor and artist Nicolas Reeves, the Aerostabile project quickly expanded to include researchers and artists from a wide range of disciplines. Its current phase brings together four robotic and research-creation labs with various expertises in unstable and dynamic environments. The first group, under the direction of professor Inna Sharf, is based at the department of mechanical engineering at University McGill. It works on control and modeling of autonomous blimps for satellite emulation. The second group is headed by professor Philippe Giguere from University Laval. It focuses on localization systems for robots operating in unknown outdoor environments. The third group is also from McGill, but this time from the computer science department. Headed by professor Gregory Dudek, it investigates the challenges presented by autonomous underwater robots, and by their interactions with human divers. The last team is based at the UQAM school of design. It is headed by professor Nicolas Reeves and engineer David St-Onge. It works on installations and performances in digital and algorithmic arts, and on the impact of new medias and technologies on the fields of art, architecture and design. The Aerostabile project pushes the boundaries of engineering and art by proposing a close hybridization of the two disciplines. It redefines the human-robot interaction paradigm, working specifically on the new interfaces required by the specific nature and context of emerging robotic systems. Multidisciplinary approaches are required to seamlessly integrate aesthetics, grace and precision. Amongst the tools and strategies developed by the research team, one of the most important is the organization of regular meetings similar to art residencies, which are structured around the framework of engineering software and hardware integration workshops. During such meetings, which occur twice a year, the four groups work together with engineers and artists from different disciplines. These intense collaborative events happen in spaces large enough to fit at least two 225-cm floating robotic cubes called "Tryphons", the latest models of a series of flying automata developed by Reeves and St-Onge. Fruitful questions and discussions emerge from these residencies, leading to new questions and development axis both in art and engineering. Whenever possible, they happen in public spaces, allowing direct contact with all kinds of audiences and with inspiring media artists and creators-researchers. The specific constraints of out-of-the-lab environments raise new problematics for all engineers, while the encounter between different academic cultures influence the development priorities. At the end of our journey, on top of the engineering papers that will be published, we aim to produce the first hybrid performance involving four performers interacting with four fully autonomous aerobots.},

abstract = {Abstract: This paper  deals with terrain mapping and position estimation using multiple robots. Here we will discuss work where a larger group of robots can mutually estimate one another's position (in 2D or 3D) and uncertainty using a sample-based  (particle filter) model of uncertainty. Our prior work has dealt with a pair of robots that estimate one another's position using visual tracking and coordinated motion and we extend these results and consider a richer set of sensing and motion options. In particular, we focus on issues related to confidence estimation for groups of more than two robots.},

abstract = {Abstract: This report presents a new sensing modality for multirobot exploration. The approach is based on using a pair of robots that observe each other's behavior, acting in concert to reduce odometry errors. We assume the robots can both directly sense nearby obstacles and see each other. The proposed approach improves the quality of the map by reducing the inaccuracies that occur over time from dead reckoning errors. Furthermore, by exploiting the ability of the robots to see each other, we can detect opaque obstacles in the environment independently of their surface reflectance properties. Two different algorithms, based on the size of the environment, are introduced, with a complexity analysis, and experimental results in simulation and with real robots.},
