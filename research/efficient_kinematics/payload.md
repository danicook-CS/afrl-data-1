# Dynamically Efficient Kinematics for Hyper-Redundant Manipulators

## Summary
The Hyper-Redundant Manipulators is an old and classic problem in Control Theory and although it seems that it has been well studied in depth the past two decades only a few time efficient algorithms have been proposed. We propose an new algorithm for solving the Kinametics that potentially reduces the size of the problem and the time needed for the soluton exponentially by simplifying the kinematic structure. The idea is that we start from a simple kinematic structure by separating the manipulator into virtual sectors, where every sector uses a subset of its kinematic abilities and then in case of failure, the kinematic structure changes as described by the meta-controller, leading to a richer kinematic structure in the next step, and an increment of the dimensionality of the problem.
