# Localizing AUVS to Sand Ripples

## Summary
Brief Abstract: AUVs face various issues underwater, since many sensors become disfunctional or show erratic behavior. These are extreme conditions which might lack in proper communication chanels. In this project we are working on vision based localization, specifically we are designing a system that localizes the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) to sand ripples found on the bed of water bodies. This involves extracting sand ripple contours from the underwater images which are usually hazy, and then use SLAM software to localize the camera to these ripples.
