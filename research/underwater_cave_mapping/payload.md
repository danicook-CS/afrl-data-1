# Underwater Cave Mapping

## Summary
This project introduces a Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) to the underwater cave exploration community ensuring there is no interference with the standard operations. Underwater cave mapping is crucial in monitoring and tracking groundwater flows in karstic aquifers. In this project we construct a volumetric maps of the cave system by deploying a stereo camera to be used in conjunction with a structured video-light carried by the diver. This detailed 3-D representations of underwater caves will give researchers a better perspective about their size, structure and connectivity as well as the insights to the hydrogeological processes that formed the caves.
